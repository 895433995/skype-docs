 _**Applies to:** Skype for Business 2015_

A conversation invitation is extended to the local user to join a conversation. Invitations can come from any version of the Skype for Business client, another Skype Web SDK-enabled web page, or a compatible client from the public cloud. 


## Responding to a conversation invitation

The SDK creates a set of objects and raises several events to support a new conversation. 


- A [Conversation](http://technet.microsoft.com/library/0c5a6d3a-d3cb-40c0-96f3-0d42c36af4a8%28Office.14%29.aspx) object is created to encapsulate the incoming conversation invitation.
    
- One or more conversation service objects such as [Conversation](http://technet.microsoft.com/library/0c5a6d3a-d3cb-40c0-96f3-0d42c36af4a8%28Office.14%29.aspx) **.chatService**,[Conversation](http://technet.microsoft.com/library/0c5a6d3a-d3cb-40c0-96f3-0d42c36af4a8%28Office.14%29.aspx) **.audioService**, or[Conversation](http://technet.microsoft.com/library/0c5a6d3a-d3cb-40c0-96f3-0d42c36af4a8%28Office.14%29.aspx) **.videoService** is created to encapsulate the conversation modes chosen by the caller.
    
- One or more [Participant](http://technet.microsoft.com/library/dd7fc650-ffe1-4306-b6cd-d2aa97a6fb99%28Office.14%29.aspx) objects are created to represent the people in the conversation.
    
- The state of one of the conversation's modalities becomes "Notified."
    
At this moment, the app must call the  **accept()** method or the **decline()** method on the[ConversationService](http://technet.microsoft.com/library/ca6fe75d-dd44-4aa4-9495-c9c07717626f%28Office.14%29.aspx) modality object. Whether the call is taken or declined depends on which method is called.

The following procedure catches the conversation-related "added" events, forms a UI prompt, accepts the user's action, and updates the app UI to show the right kind of content:


### Respond to a conversation invitation


1. Listen for the  **added** event on the[ConversationsManager](http://technet.microsoft.com/library/b412eed4-1cbe-4471-ae3d-c4f38a8f7284%28Office.14%29.aspx) **.conversations** collection for new conversations.
    
2. For a new conversation, listen for change events on the service's  **state** property as enumerated[CallConnectionState](http://technet.microsoft.com/library/b06fd7bc-857d-4bec-8ff3-98e2d6d3b42d%28Office.14%29.aspx) . If the state is 'Notified', then it indicates the incoming invite.
    
3. If it is an incoming IM invite, call the [ChatService](http://technet.microsoft.com/library/738a2869-3d8e-4901-b666-348c204f5195%28Office.14%29.aspx) **.accept** method to accept the invite.
    
4. You may call the [ChatService](http://technet.microsoft.com/library/738a2869-3d8e-4901-b666-348c204f5195%28Office.14%29.aspx) **reject** method to decline the invite.
    
The following example shows how to accept an incoming IM call.




```
//Register a listener for incoming calls
conversationsManager.conversations.added(function (conversation) {
    if (conversation.chatService.accept.enabled()) {
        // this is an incoming IM call
        conversation.chatService.accept();
    }
});

```

The following example shows how to reject an incoming IM call.




```
//Register a listener for incoming calls
conversationsManager.conversations.added(function (conversation) {
    if (conversation.chatService.enabled()) {
        // this is an incoming IM call
        Conversation.chatService.reject();
    }
});

```

The following example shows how to accept an incoming audio call.




```
//Register a listener for incoming calls
conversationsManager.conversations.added(function (conversation) {
    if (conversation.audioService.accept.enabled()) {
        // this is an incoming audio call
        conversation.audioService.accept();
    }
});

```

The following example shows how to reject an incoming audio call.




```
//Register a listener for incoming calls
conversationsManager.conversations.added(function (conversation) {
    if (conversation.audioService.enabled()) {
        // this is an incoming audio call
        Conversation.audioService.reject();
    }
});

```

The following example shows how to accept an incoming video call.




```
//Register a listener for incoming calls
conversationsManager.conversations.added(function (conversation) {
    if (conversation.videoService.accept.enabled()) {
        // this is an incoming video call
        conversation.videoService.accept();
    }
});

```

The following example shows how to reject an incoming video call.




```
//Register a listener for incoming calls
conversationsManager.conversations.added(function (conversation) {
    if (conversation.videoService.enabled()) {
        // this is an incoming video call
        Conversation.videoService.reject();
    }
});

```
