You will not give feedback that is subject to a license that requires Microsoft to license its software or documentation to third parties because we include your feedback in them. These rights survive this agreement.

Unless applicable law gives you more rights despite this limitation, you may use the software only as expressly permitted in this agreement.

9.  **APPLICABLE LAW.**
    
      1.  **United States.** If you acquired the software in the United States, Washington state law governs the interpretation of this agreement and applies to claims for breach of it, regardless of conflict of laws principles. The laws of the state where you live govern all other claims, including claims under state consumer protection laws, unfair competition laws, and in tort.
    
  2.  **Outside the United States.** If you acquired the software in any other country, the laws of that country apply.
    
10.  **LEGAL EFFECT.** This agreement describes certain legal rights. You may have other rights under the laws of your country.

      - anything related to the software, services, content (including code) on third party Internet sites, or third party programs; and
    
  - claims for breach of contract, breach of warranty, guarantee or condition, strict liability, negligence, or other tort to the extent permitted by applicable law.
    
    It also applies even if Microsoft knew or should have known about the possibility of the damages. The above limitation or exclusion may not apply to you because your country may not allow the exclusion or limitation of incidental, consequential or other damages.
