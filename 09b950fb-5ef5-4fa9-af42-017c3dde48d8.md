### Using the mePerson object

The [MePerson](http://technet.microsoft.com/library/a71b0536-3c1a-487b-b734-33e4efbea3b5%28Office.14%29.aspx) object is retrieved through the **[application](http://technet.microsoft.com/library/e0969542-53e2-473a-b02f-2554b01451f1%28Office.14%29.aspx).[personsAndGroupsManager](http://technet.microsoft.com/library/ce912c52-5bed-47b1-b4e0-ce4328297c87%28Office.14%29.aspx).mePerson** property. For example, the following JavaScript code sample sets the availability of the signed in user to online.


```
// tell the mePerson to change the availability state

personsAndGroupsManager.mePerson.status.set('Online').then(function () {
    alert('The status of mePerson has been changed');
}).then(null, function (error) {
    // and if could not be changed, report the failure
    alert(error || 'The server has rejected this availability state.');
});

```

|Property|Description|
|location|Gets or sets the location of the signed in user.|
|note|Gets or sets the personal note of the signed in user.|
|status|Gets or sets the availability of the signed in user.|
 **Note:** When the above values contain special characters such as <, >, and / they will be padded with zero width whitespace. This can cause equality operations to fail unexpectedly. One option for handling this situation is to filter out these special values so they are not used.
