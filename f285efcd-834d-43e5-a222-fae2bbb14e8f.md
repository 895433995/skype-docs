# Join a meeting anonymously

 **Last modified:** April 23, 2015

 _**Applies to:** Skype for Business_




## 

A client can join an existing meeting anonymously with that meeting's URI.

 **Organizer**:


1. Schedules a Skype for Business conference and shares meeting URI with the user.
    
2. Ensures conference allows all users to join the conference.
    
 **Anonymous users**:

Once they have a meeting URI from the organizer, for example: sip:user@contoso.com;gruu;opaque=app:conf:focus:id:1WRB13D2, they first need to:


1. Sign in the anonymous user using the meeting URI.
    
2. Get the conversation object for this conference.
    
3. Start the needed service in the conversation.
    

### Joining a meeting anonymously


1. Sign in the anonymous user using the meeting URI.
    
  ```
  var uri = 'sip:user@contoso.com;gruu;opaque-app:conf:focus:id:1WRB13D2';
application.signInManager.signIn({
  name: 'Robin',
  meeting: uri
});

  ```

2. Get the conversation object for this conference.
    
  ```
  var conversation = application.conversationsManager.getConversationByUri(uri)
  ```

3. Start the needed service in the conversation.
    
  ```
  conversation.chatService.start().then(function() {
	// Successfully joined conversation chat
	...
});
  ```

4.  **Alternatively:** Clients may also join the meeting by starting the audio service.
    
  ```
  conversation.audioService.start().then(function() {
	// Successfully joined conversation audio
});
  ```


Or clients can join the meeting by starting the video service.
    


  ```
  conversation.videoService.start().then(function() {
	// Successfully joined conversation video
});
  ```
