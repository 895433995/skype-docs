# Trusted Application API samples

To jump start developement with the Trusted Application API, we've created two sample applications that you can clone or download from GitHub

## Console application

The console application can be considered a "100 level" sample. It shows you how to make the minimum usable calls against the Trusted Application API. There are only
five steps to deploy this application.  Be sure to get familiar with this sample and deploy it before you tackle the next sample.

## Express meeting join application

This sample can actually be deployed on in a cloud such as Azure and it will let you complete a simple online meeting join scenario. It requires that you
spend a little bit more time in Azure application registration so that you can set up needed Azure resources.
