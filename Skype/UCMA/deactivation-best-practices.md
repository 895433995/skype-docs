An application can be deactivated by following the steps in the following procedure.

### To deactivate an application

    On the **Start** menu, select **All Programs**, select **Skype for Business Server 2015**, and then click **Skype for Business Server Management Shell**.

2.  Remove the Active Directory contacts and [ApplicationEndpoint](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/hh384825\(v=office.16\)) instances that you no longer need by running following PowerShell cmdlet.
    
    Remove-CsTrustedApplicationEndpoint -Identity sip:ExternalApp@mydomain.com
    

    > [!NOTE]
    > <P>Use the appropriate identity for your <STRONG>ApplicationEndpoint</STRONG> instance.</P>

    Remove-CsTrustedApplicationPool -identity "MyAppPool.contoso.com"
    

    > [!NOTE]
    > <P>Use the appropriate identity for your pool.</P>

    

    > [!NOTE]
