        <h3>Select a group to remove that group.</h3>
        <p>The personAndGroupsManager object exposes a group, all, which contains all persons and all groups.  Using this property we can get access to the groups collection call remove providing a group object or name and have that group removed from the user.  In this example we populate a select list containing groups that can be removed.  When the group is successfully removed a removed event will be emitted on the groups collection.</p>
