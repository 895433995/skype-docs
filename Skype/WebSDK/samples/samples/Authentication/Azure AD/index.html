        <h3>Provide a client id to sign-in.</h3>
        <p>Getting OAuth correct is not an easy task, but it can be thought of as a few easy to follow steps.  First will be to create users who will be authorized for this online application (more information can be found at: <a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/documentation/articles/active-directory-create-users/" target="_blank">Create or edit users in Azure AD</a>).  Next we create an application in the portal and add delegate permissions for Skype for Business Online and provide a Reply URL.  The exact URL can be found below, so feel free to copy it when creating your application in the Azure Portal.</p>
        <p>We will also need to make an additional step to enable the OAuth 2.0 Implicit Grant flow which involves manual editing of the application manifest.  Check out <a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/documentation/articles/active-directory-integrating-applications/" target="_blank">Integrating Applications with Azure Active Directory</a> and look for the section about <b>Enabling OAuth 2.0 Implicit Grant for Single Page Applications</b>.</p>
        <p>Once that application is created we should now have a Client ID that we can use for sign-in by redirecting for authorization.  Upon succesfully login, the authorization page should redirect back to the main page where a hash value will be present in the URL.  This framework has code built-in to handle checking for this value and completing sign-in.</p>
        <p>It is advised to not be logged into multiple MSA accounts when testing out OAuth because multiple users will confuse the sign-in process preventing proper authentication.  For best results consider running in your browser's private mode if available.</p>
