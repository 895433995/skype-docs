        <h3>Add event listeners and wait for an invitation.</h3>
        <p>The application object exposes a conversationsManager object that exposes a conversations collection which we can attach an event listener for added to be notified when new invitations for conversations arrive.  When a conversation is added we can add an event listener for when the audioService object accept command is enabled which means that this conversation would be for audio.  We also should listen for when we disconnect from the conversation.</p>
        </p>When the accept command is enabled we can choose to either accept the invitation or reject via respective commands and in this example it is handled via confirm(...).  In the case of accepting the invitation, we should add event listeners for added participants.</p>
