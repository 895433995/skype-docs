The **Skype for Business** team responds to the developer communitity across several channels. Please tell us about your:

* Questions: We listen and respond on [stackoverflow](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/skype-for-business). Tag your question with "skype-for-business" so that our team and the **Skype for Business** developer
community can respond with helpful answers.

* Documentation bugs: If you find a bug in the **App SDK** documentation, open an [issue](https://github.com/OfficeDev/skype-docs/issues) on **GitHub**. Be sure to tell us which topic
is factually incorrect or unclear. To help us fix the problem more quickly, quote the text to be changed. 

* API bugs: Please contact us via our [Skype developer insiders email](mailto:skypedevinsiders@microsoft.com ) box. We are on an agile release cadence and will respond quickly to get more information
about the bug you are reporting.

* Feature requests: If our API doesn't empower you to do a feature that you really need, please contact us via our [Skype feedback](http://www.skypefeedback.com/) channel.

* Sample application bugs: If you find a bug in one of our samples, open an issue for [Android sample issues](https://github.com/OfficeDev/skype-android-app-sdk-samples/issues) or [iOS sample issues](https://github.com/OfficeDev/skype-ios-app-sdk-samples/issues) on **GitHub**. Be sure to describe the steps to reproduce the bug.

* Contributions: We accept pull requests against our SDK documentation and our samples. If you'd like to contribute to the documentation, go to our [skype-docs GitHub repository](https://github.com/OfficeDev/skype-docs).
