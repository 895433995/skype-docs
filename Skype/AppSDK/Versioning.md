# Versioning and staying up to date

We anticipate that the SDK will be updated frequently with new capabilities.

* Once the SDK is generally available, weâ€™ll make every effort to ensure API back-compatibility with previous versions.  We will communicate any breaking changes clearly.
* To allow the SDK to move forward quickly, our guidance will be to update to the latest SDK at least every six months.  Where an app is based on an older version of the SDK, it may need to be updated so that:
  * We can investigate an issue report
  * It continues to work against Skype for Business Online or the latest Skype for Business Server CU; such occurrences should be rare and will be communicated with good notice.
* Fixes to bugs will typically be delivered only in new versions of the SDK and not back-ported to previous versions.
