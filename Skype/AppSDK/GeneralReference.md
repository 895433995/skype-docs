The Skype Developer Platform for Apps ("Skype App SDK") is a set of native APIs that enable you to build mobile experiences that seamlessly integrate a wide variety of real-time collaboration models leveraging Skype for Business services and the larger Skype network. In addition to support for multiple core collaboration services like presence, chat, audio, and video, it enables web experiences that can connect to a broad spectrum of users, browsing platforms, and device endpoints.

Skype App SDK provides meeting services for Android and iOS mobile platforms. Support for audio/video conversations is natively supported via API. There is no need to download additional support libraries. The net result is a powerful new model for building immersive collaboration experiences using the power of Skype and Skype for Business.
